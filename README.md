# RMIT Driverless Simulator.  
 
Based upon CAT vehicle simulator, see below for details.  
To use as is of 26/8/2020,  
1: install cat vehicle sim as below  
2: download this repository onto your desktop  
3: Open files in ubuntuand use the command (CTRL+H) to see hidden folders.   
4. Navigate to ~/Home/.gazebo/models/  
5: Open a new tab in files (CTRL+T) and navigate to the dowloaded repository  
6: In the tracks folder, copy all folders (acceleration, big_track, skidpad, small_track)  
7. Paste these in ~/Home/.gazebo/models/  
8: now copy the 'urdf', 'worlds', 'meshes' and 'launch' folders from the downloaded depository  
9: paste them in 'your_workspace'/src/catvehicle and overwrite the folders that are named identicly, you may need to delete them first  
10: you should be good to launch them now  

# Launching and running model with gazebo:  
1: Open a terminal and run, $ roscore  
2: In a new terminal window or tab (CTRL+shift+t) run $ roslaunch catvehicle catvehicle_big_track.launch  
2a: other tracks include,                             $ roslaunch catvehicle catvehicle_small_track.launch  
                                                      $ roslaunch catvehicle catvehicle_skidpad.launch  
                                                      $ roslaunch catvehicle catvehicle_acceleration.launch  
3: In a new terminal run $ gzclient  
4: This will open gazebo, click on gazebo and the model should be in the enviroment you launched  
# optional   
5: To move the vehicle open a new terminal and run $ rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py /cmd_vel:=/catvehicle/cmd_vel  
5a: This window must be open and currently clicked on to recieve keystrokes. speed is very slow to begin so hold q to increase speed.  
6: To view cameras and lidar data and to visualise it use $ rosrun rviz rviz   
6a: In rvis set Fixed Frame to catvehicle/odom, and use add to add lidar or cameras from topic menu. To add the robot use add and select RobotModel from 'By Display Type'. Then change Robot Description to catvehicle/robot_description and TF Prefix to catvehicle

# Cognitive and Autonomous Test Vehicle (CAT Vehicle) Testbed
The CAT Vehicle is a ROS based simulator to facilitate the development of autonomous vehicle applications. This repository houses the files that utilize the Gazebo simulator, and additional interfaces to the physical CAT Vehicle Testbed available at the University of Arizona - Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

# What's new
* Released for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, ROS Melodic and Gazebo 9.0
* Support for front camera
* More stable vehicle dynamics
* Bug fixes and improvements

# How to use it

## Installing ROS
* Follow the steps mentioned in the [ROS wiki page](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu%C2%A0) on how to install ROS Melodic. 
* In addition to that we are required to install some additional ros packages
```shell
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-velodyne ros-melodic-novatel-span-driver
```

## Creating catkin workspace
In order to use the catvehicle ROS package, you should work within a catkin workspace. If you do not already have one:
```shell
cd ~
mkdir -p catvehicle_ws/src
cd catvehicle_ws/src
catkin_init_workspace
cd ..
catkin_make
```

At this point, you can extract this release package from [catvehicle-3.0.1](https://github.com/jmscslgroup/catvehicle/releases/download/3.0.1/catvehicle-3.0.1.tar.xz) and other dependent package into your src directory
```shell
cd ~/catvehicle_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/jmscslgroup/catvehicle
git clone https://github.com/jmscslgroup/obstaclestopper
git clone https://github.com/jmscslgroup/control_toolbox
git clone https://github.com/jmscslgroup/sicktoolbox
git clone https://github.com/jmscslgroup/sicktoolbox_wrapper
git clone https://github.com/jmscslgroup/stepvel
git clone https://github.com/jmscslgroup/cmdvel2gazebo
cd ..
catkin_make
```
## Sourcing workspace to the environment path
```bash
echo "source ~/catvehicle_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```

# Simple tutorial and examples
Follow the tutorials on the CAT Vehicle Testbed group on the [CPS Virtual Organization](https://cps-vo.org/group/CATVehicleTestbed) to see how to use the testbed.

# Issues
If you run into a problem, please feel free to post to [issues](https://github.com/jmscslgroup/catvehicle/issues). If the issue is urgent, please email to catvehicle@list.arizona.edu.
